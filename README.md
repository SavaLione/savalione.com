## Build and install
First of all you need to install bundler and Jekyll.
In order to do so check Jekyll's official documentation:
* [Jekyll installation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
* [Jekyll installation on Ubuntu](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/)

To compile the project you need to:
1. Clone repository:
    * `git clone https://github.com/SavaLione/savalione.com.git`
2. Change directory:
    * `cd savalione.com`
3. Install bundler additional dependencies:
    * `bundle install`
4. Compile the blog:
    * `bundle exec jekyll build`

By executing `jekyll build` the blog will be compiled in the `./public` directory.
If you want to run a local version of the blog, you can use `jekyll server` command:
* `bundle exec jekyll server -H 0.0.0.0`
