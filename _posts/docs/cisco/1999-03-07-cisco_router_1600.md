## Product Overview
The Cisco 1600 series have become the proven choice for data access for small branch offices and small businesses because they offer a range of features specifically designed for such applications:
* Modular design for wide-area network (WAN) choice and flexibility
* Advanced security, including optional integrated firewall, encryption, and virtual private network (VPN) software
* End-to-end quality of service (QoS) and multimedia support
* Integrated data service unit/channel service unit (DSU/CSU) with up to T1 speed and integrated Network Termination (NT1)
* Low cost of ownership through WAN bandwidth optimization
* Ease of use, deployment, and management

The Cisco 1700 series routers build on the success of the Cisco 1600 routers, delivering multiservice capabilities, as well as
greater modularity, security, and integration to small offices.

### Cisco 1600 Series Modular Routers
Cisco 1600 series routers connect small offices with Ethernet LANs to WANs through Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN),
asynchronous serial, and synchronous serial connections.

The five basic configurations of the Cisco 1600 product family offer the following ports:
* Cisco 1601 R - one Ethernet, one serial, one WAN interface
* Cisco 1602 R - one Ethernet, one serial with integrated 56-kbps DSU/CSU, one WAN interface card slot
* Cisco 1603 R - one Ethernet, one ISDN Basic Rate Interface (BRI) (S/T interface), one WAN interface card slot
* Cisco 1604 R - one Ethernet, one ISDN BRI with integrated NT1 (U interface), one S-bus port for ISDN phones, one WAN interface card slot
* Cisco 1605 R - two Ethernet slots, one WAN interface card slot

The serial WAN port on the Cisco 1601 R router supports asynchronous serial connections of up to 115.2 kbps and
synchronous serial connections — such as Frame Relay, leased lines, Switched 56, Switched Multimegabit Data Service
(SMDS), and X.25 — of up to 2.048 Mbps. The Cisco 1602 R router integrates a 56-kbps four-wire DSU/CSU, and it
supports the same synchronous serial connections as the Cisco 1601 R router (except SMDS). The ISDN BRI port on the
Cisco 1603 R router has an S/T interface, while the Cisco 1604 R includes an integrated NT1 with a U interface. The Cisco
1605 R router provides a 10BaseT and an AUI port on the first Ethernet interface and a 10BaseT port on the second Ethernet
interface.

### Run From RAM Architecture
The 1601 R-1605 R routers have a “run-from-RAM” architecture; the “R” suffix designates run from “RAM”. The Cisco
IOS software image is stored in Flash memory (in compressed form), but is loaded into RAM before being executed by the
router.

The Run-from-RAM models offer the following benefits:
1. Greater Performance - The Cisco 1600 R models deliver greater performance for memory-intensive applications such as encryption and compression
2. Easier Upgradability - The Cisco 1600 R routers permit software upgrades over any interface while the router is running
3. Lower Cost - Because the Cisco 1600 R models store the software in compressed form in Flash memory, less flash memory is required to run advanced feature sets (such as Cisco 1600 series IOS IP Plus). The new Cisco 1600 R routers (1601 R, 1602 R, 1603 R, and 1604 R) are essentially the same as the original models (1601-1604), but they are "fun-from-RAM"
routers, similar to the Cisco 1605 R model introduced in late 1997. The new Cisco 1600 R models deliver all the
features and benefits of the original models, including the same interfaces, the same functionality, the same feature sets, and
the same versions of Cisco IOS (R) software and have the same physical dimensions.

### Key Features and Benefits
#### Flexibility and Investment Protection
The WAN interface card slot allows customers to change or add WAN interface cards as their requirements grow or change.
With this feature, the Cisco 1600 series offers more flexibility and investment protection than any other product in its class.
What’s more, the ability to use the same WAN interface cards in Cisco 1600, 1700, 2600, and 3600 routers reduces
requirements for spare parts inventory and protects investments in existing routers

|:Optional WAN Interface Cards Available:||||||
|WAN Interface Card|1601 R|1602 R|1603 R|1604 R|1605 R|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|Serial, asynchronous and synchronous|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|T1/Fractional T1 DSU/CSU            |Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|56/64-kbps four-wire DSU/CSU        |Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|ISDN BRI with S/T interface (dial & leased line)|Yes|Yes| | |Yes|
|ISDN BRI with integrated NT1, U interface (dial & leased line)|Yes|Yes| | |Yes|
|ISDN BRI leased line (S/T interface)| | |Yes|Yes| |

The ISDN BRI Leased Line S/T card is designed specifically for the Cisco 1603 R and 1604 R routers. It is intended for users
who require a dial-up ISDN BRI line (from the Cisco 1603 R or 1604 R router’s fixed-WAN port) and an ISDN leased line
(from the ISDN BRI Leased Line card inserted into the Cisco 1603 R or 1604 R router). This card is automatically configured
only in ISDN leased line mode.

#### Device Integration
Cisco 1600 routers deliver a complete solution for remote access for small businesses and small branch offices. They provide
not only advanced routing capabilities but also the option to integrate DSU/CSU and ISDN network T1 device (NT1), as well
as firewall, encryption, and VPN functionality. This integration reduces deployment time and expense because fewer devices
and cables need to be installed and configured. An integrated product also saves space and increases reliability because fewer
stand alone devices are required to build the solution. The Cisco 1600 routers simplify ongoing support of small branch
offices from a central site through remote configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting of all integrated functions in the
router

#### Advanced Security
To leverage the unprecedented opportunities offered by communications and commerce over the Internet, private information
must remain secure. Cisco IOS security services provide many technologies to build a custom security solution. The elements
of security services include perimeter security, firewalls, encryption, and VPNs

##### Perimeter Security
Perimeter security refers to the control of traffic entry and exit between network boundaries, such as between private
networks, intranets, extranets, or the Internet. Cisco IOS perimeter security technologies provide a highly flexible, superior
solution with features such as:
* Standard and extended access control lists (ACLs)
* Lock and Key (dynamic ACLs)
* Router/route authentication, authorization, and accounting (such as PAP/CHAP, TACACS+, and RADIUS)

##### Firewall
The optional Cisco IOS Firewall Feature Set, available on all Cisco 1600 models, provides formidable firewall functionality,
including:
* Context-based access control (CBAC)
* Java blocking
* Attack detection and prevention
* Improved logging and alerts

CBAC provides stateful application-layer security by examining traffic sessions on a per-application basis and allowing
return traffic through the firewall. When a session is initiated internally, CBAC writes a temporary, session-specific ACL
entry and deletes the ACL entry upon session termination.

The Cisco 1605 R router - which supports one WAN slot, two Ethernet ports, and the Cisco IOS Firewall Feature Set -
makes an ideal integrated and flexible firewall for small offices. This integrated router/firewall effectively segments an
internal, secure LAN from a perimeter LAN exposed to an untrusted network (such as the Internet), thus creating a
“demilitarized zone.”

See the Cisco IOS Firewall Feature Set data sheet for further details

##### Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and Encryption
The Cisco 1600 series routers may be deployed as an entry-level VPN access solution, supporting DES encryption at rates
of up to 128 kbps. The Cisco 1720 router is recommended for VPN applications that require greater performance or 3DES
or both. Cisco IOS software for the Cisco 1600 series provides a comprehensive set of VPN features, including not only
perimeter security and firewalls but also the following key technologies:
* IPSec tunneling with data encryption standard (DES)
* Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F) and Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)
* VPN management tools such as support for VPN policy configuration in Cisco ConfigMaker

#### Cisco IOS Software Features for Small Office Data Access
Cisco 1600 series routers offer small businesses and small branch offices a complete set of internetworking software features.
In addition to the features mentions earlier, Cisco IOS software differentiates the Cisco 1600 series from the competition
with:
* Multiprotocol routing (IP, IPX, AppleTalk), IBM/SNA, and transparent bridging over ISDN, asynchronous serial, and synchronous serial such as leased lines, Frame Relay, SMDS, Switched 56, X.25, and X.25 over D
* Network Address Translation (NAT), which eliminates the need to re-address all hosts with existing private network addresses and hides internal addresses from public view
* Easy IP - a combination of NAT, Point-to-Point Protocol/Internet Control Protocol (PPP/IPCP) and Dynamic Host
* Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server - which enables the router to dynamically negotiate its own IP address and dynamically allocate local IP addresses to the remote LAN hosts, simplifies deployment, and minimizes Internet access costs
* End-to-end QoS features such as Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP), IP Multicast, WFQ, and AppleTalk Simple Multicast Routing Protocol (SMRP), which support multimedia applications such as desktop video conferencing, distance learning, and voice/data integration
* WAN optimization features such as dial-on-demand routing (DDR), bandwidth-on-demand (BOD), and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)-on-demand circuit, Snapshot routing, compression, filtering, and spoofing to reduce WAN costs

#### Easy to Use
The Cisco 1600 series includes a variety of easy, user-friendly installation and configuration features such as color coded
ports, removable Flash memory PC cards for easy software deployment, the Cisco ConfigMaker configuration tool and the
Cisco Fast Step software tool. These features combine to give the lowest total cost of ownership of any small office router

Each Cisco 1600 series router includes the Cisco Fast Step easy-to-use Windows 95, 98, and NT 4.0-based software tool that
simplifies the setup, monitoring, and troubleshooting of Cisco routers. The Cisco Fast Step setup application leads users
through simple, step-by-step, wizards-based procedures to configure Cisco routers connected to an Internet service provider
and remote corporate network. Cisco Fast Step software includes the Cisco Fast Step monitor application, which provides
users with router LAN and WAN performance statistics, fault alarms, and troubleshooting assistance.

The Cisco ConfigMaker application is appropriate for advanced configuration of the Cisco 1600 series routers. A Windows
95, 98, and NT 4.0-based software tool, Cisco ConfigMaker is designed to configure a small network of Cisco routers,
switches, hubs, and other network devised from a single PC. Cisco ConfigMaker is designed for resellers and network
administrators of small and medium-sized businesses who are proficient in LAN and WAN fundamentals and basic network
design. Cisco ConfigMaker includes support for the Cisco IOS Firewall Feature Set (which provides integrated enhanced
security capabilities), Network Address Translation (NAT), and Cisco Easy IP software.

In addition to easy-to-use software, the hardware for the Cisco 1600 routers is designed to be “plug-and-play” in four notable
areas. First, each of the ports on the Cisco 1600 routers and WAN interface cards is color coded, and optional color-coded
cables can be purchased from Cisco. Second, preconfigured software may be loaded into a Flash memory PC card at a central
site, and then a user at remote site may deploy the router by simply inserting the Flash card, plugging in cables, and turning
on the power. Third, once the router is running, software upgrades and configuration modifications can be downloaded over
the WAN from a central site. And finally, the Cisco 1600 series allows for centralized administration and management via
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) or Telnet or through the console port.
