Hi!
I'm Savelii Pototskii.
Welcome to my personal blog!

I am a software engineer specializing in backend systems, performance optimization, network applications, and open-source software.
I care deeply about the open-source ecosystem because I believe it is the future of technology.

This blog is where I share my thoughts, insights, and practical knowledge on topics like Go, C++, Linux, FPGAs, and the broader open-source world.
My aim is to create content that is open, informative, and helpful.
