Hi!
I'm Savelii Pototskii.
Welcome to my personal blog!

I am a software developer specializing in backend applications, performance optimization, network-side applications, and open-source software.
My passion lies in exploring the depths of technology, from low-level hardware interactions to complex software architectures.

This blog is where I share my journey, insights, and practical knowledge on topics like C++, Go, Linux, FPGAs, and the broader open-source ecosystem.
My aim is to create content that is both informative and helpful to fellow developers and tech enthusiasts.
I believe strongly in the power of open source and am committed to advocating for its benefits.
